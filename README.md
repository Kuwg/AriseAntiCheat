# AriseAntiCheat
Minecraft Anticheat with many checks developed!

It's a really extensive anticheat, but it's obfuscated (for now at least) because it took really long to make and I don't want peoples to steal my code.
It's still fully free and there's no "pro" version.
You can configure enabled checks, violations and decide if you want to make a check punishable or not, but for now that's all, in the future I might add more configs but it's not in my plans. 
As far as I tested it, there is no flight that doesn't flag, but it lacks of a ground speed check since it'd take long to make and I'm busy with school.
I hope you enjoy my little masterpiece!
