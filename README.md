# AriseAntiCheat
Minecraft Anticheat with many checks developed!

It's a highly comprehensive anticheat, albeit currently obfuscated, primarily due to the extensive time investment in its development. I'm cautious about code theft, hence the obfuscation—for now, at least. The anticheat remains entirely free, with no "pro" version available.

You have the flexibility to configure enabled checks, violations, and determine whether a check should result in punishment. However, as of now, that's the extent of the customization options. While I may consider adding more configurations in the future, it's not currently part of my plans.

Based on my testing, every instance of flight triggers a flag. However, there's a lack of a ground speed check, as creating one would be time-consuming, and my current focus is on school commitments.

I hope you find my creation enjoyable—a small masterpiece in its own right! Please remember to place both PacketAPI and AriseAC in the plugins folder; otherwise, the anticheat won't function correctly. You are free to use PacketAPI, but if utilized for purposes other than personal use, kindly provide proper credits.


*Both the plugins support /reload command.
