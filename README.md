# Arise 2.0 - Free Minecraft Anti Cheat

Welcome to AriseAntiCheat, your reliable Minecraft companion armed with checks to maintain order on your server!

## Overview

This anticheat isn't just your average tool; it's been carefully crafted with dedication. The code is currently kept low-key—not to show off but to ward off any prying eyes.

AriseAntiCheat isn't just powerful; it's free. No fancy "pro" version to worry about. You decide what checks are active, how many strikes lead to trouble, and if trouble is worth a timeout. While the current setup is solid, future plans may bring more options.

## Testing and Focus

All checks (especially Flights) are really; someone tries to cheat, and we're there to flag it. No ground speed check yet—why? It's time-consuming, and currently, the focus is on academic commitments.
I implemented 3 reach checks (First two for players, third for mobs), and all three are made to not false flag.

## Let's Dive In

Enjoy using AriseAntiCheat! Don't forget the basics: place both PacketAPI and AriseAC in your plugins folder. Without them, the anticheat might decide to take a day off.

And if you decide to play with PacketAPI outside your personal space, toss some credits our way. It's the respectful thing to do.

*Both plugins are compatible with the /reload command.*
