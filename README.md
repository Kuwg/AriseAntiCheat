# AriseAntiCheat - Minecraft Guardian

Welcome to AriseAntiCheat, your vigilant Minecraft companion equipped with a plethora of checks to keep your server secure!

## Overview

It's not just an anticheat; it's a meticulously crafted masterpiece. The code, though currently obfuscated, speaks volumes about the dedication invested in its creation. The decision to keep it obfuscated is driven by a desire to safeguard against potential code theft.

AriseAntiCheat is not just powerful but also free—there's no "pro" version to worry about. The configuration options offer you control over enabled checks, violations, and the decision-making process regarding punishments. While the current feature set is robust, future plans may include additional configurations, adding even more flexibility to your server management.

## Testing and Focus

Flight checks are top-notch—every instance triggers a flag. However, the absence of a ground speed check is intentional. Developing one would be time-consuming, and, currently, the focus is on academic commitments.

## Enjoy the Craft

I hope you relish the experience AriseAntiCheat brings to your Minecraft world. Don't forget the essentials: ensure both PacketAPI and AriseAC are snugly placed in your plugins folder. Without them, the anticheat won't spread its protective wings.

Feel free to harness the power of PacketAPI, but if you extend its use beyond personal boundaries, a simple nod in the form of proper credits would be appreciated.

*Both plugins gracefully support the /reload command.*
