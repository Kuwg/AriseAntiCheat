# AriseAntiCheat
Minecraft Anticheat with many checks developed!

It's a really extensive anticheat, but it's obfuscated (for now at least) because it took really long to make and I don't want peoples to steal my code.
It's still fully free and there's no "pro" version.
You can configure enabled checks, violations and decide if you want to make a check punishable or not, but for now that's all, in the future I might add more configs but it's not in my plans. 
As far as I tested it, there is no flight that doesn't flag, but it lacks of a ground speed check since it'd take long to make and I'm busy with school.
I hope you enjoy my little masterpiece!
Remember to put both PacketAPI & AriseAC in the plugins folder, either it won't work, and you are free to use my PacketAPI but give me the credits if you want to use it anywhere that's not for personal use.
